            We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make
            a change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of
            this page. When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are
            agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That’s true for any of our
            existing and future Services and all features that we add to our
            Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or
            enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so,
            we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a

          <p>
            If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account and
            suspend our Services. That’s a broad statement and it means you need
