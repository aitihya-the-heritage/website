        <h3>Aitihya The Heritage</h3>
        <p>
          A Multi-lingual Research Journal on Indology in English, Bengali, and
          Assamese, pertaining to the discipline of humanities is published by
          Aitihya Samstha Foundation, of Guwahati, Assam, India.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a bi-annual (half-yearly) publication that is published during
          the month of March-April and September-October every year. It is a
          peer reviewed (refereed) research journal which is referred to by
          different Universities in West-Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya,
          New-Delhi etc. The Journal encourages high quality research papers in
          any one of the above mentioned three languages, on any topic within
          the discipline of Humanities, particularly related to India, after
          being thoroughly scrutinized by the Editorial Board and by the
          recommendation of the respective experts in the corresponding fields.
          Throughout the years, right from the time of its first publication in
          the year 2010 till the present day having published its issue no. 24 (
          Vol.XIII, Issue-1, 2022) the journal has received a very high applause
          from the researcher community including scholars and academicians from
          different parts of India and abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of recent, more than 400 Colleges and Universities in Assam,
          West-Bengal, Tripura, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Orissa, and New-Delhi have
          their subscription to this journal on a regular basis.

        <h3>Mission & vision</h3>
        <p>
          The existence of every living and non-living entity in the universe is
          directed by a ‘mission’, a ‘vision’ which in other words can be termed
          as a ‘purpose’. As such the subsistence of a journal cannot be
          debarred from such a purpose. From the earliest times a journal in
          different nations and countries has been the prime reflector or mode
          of expressing the sentiments, need, feelings and emotions, urgent
          issues to do with human civilization. It carries in its shoulders a
          responsibility towards the society, towards the nation, towards the
          universe at large. Aithiya-The Heritage is conceptualized with such a
          purpose to come to terms with certain issues of the present times—the
          most important being realizing and retaining one’s identity which is
          in culmination with one’s heritage. Under the face of growing changes
          that are taking place every now and then it is important and necessary
          to accept the changes with an eye on retaining one’s originality,
          one’s tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          History has shown how the rich heritage of our country has attracted
          outsiders from far of land who tried to invade it, western scholars
          who have researched on the resources of our country realizing its rich
          heritage. It is hoped that the journal will help in realizing the rich
          Indian heritage thus adding to classical scholarship and research that
          would enhance further the development of our country in scholarly
          terms.
