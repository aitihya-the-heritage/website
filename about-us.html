      <h1>Mission & vision</h1>
      <p>
        The existence of every living and non-living entity in the universe is
        directed by a ‘mission’, a ‘vision’ which in other words can be termed
        as a ‘purpose’. As such the subsistence of a journal cannot be debarred
        from such a purpose. From the earliest times a journal in different
        nations and countries has been the prime reflector or mode of expressing
        the sentiments, need, feelings and emotions, urgent issues to do with
        human civilization. It carries in its shoulders a responsibility towards
        the society, towards the nation, towards the universe at large.
        Aithiya-The Heritage is conceptualized with such a purpose to come to
        terms with certain issues of the present times—the most important being
        realizing and retaining one’s identity which is in culmination with
        one’s heritage. Under the face of growing changes that are taking place
        every now and then it is important and necessary to accept the changes
        with an eye on retaining one’s originality, one’s tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        History has shown how the rich heritage of our country has attracted
        outsiders from far of land who tried to invade it, western scholars who
        have researched on the resources of our country realizing its rich
        heritage. It is hoped that the journal will help in realizing the rich
        Indian heritage thus adding to classical scholarship and research that
        would enhance further the development of our country in scholarly terms.
